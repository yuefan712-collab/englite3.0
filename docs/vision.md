# EngLite Vision

EngLite is a language infrastructure project designed to reduce cognitive load,
improve literacy, and make English accessible to both humans and machines.

We believe written language should be logical, learnable, and fair.

Current English spelling creates unnecessary barriers for:
- Children and early learners
- People with dyslexia and learning differences
- Non-native English speakers
- AI and NLP systems

EngLite does not change meaning or culture.
It only patches the rendering layer of English.

Our long-term vision is to provide a parallel, logic-based spelling system
that can coexist with traditional English while improving global access to knowledge.
