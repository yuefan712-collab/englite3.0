# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and logic-driven community,
we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the EngLite
project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity.

EngLite exists to reduce cognitive barriers to language, especially for people
with dyslexia and other learning differences. Discrimination or shaming of any
kind is strictly prohibited.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using clear, logic-based arguments rather than personal opinions
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what improves clarity, accessibility, and efficiency

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
- Dyslexia-shaming or mocking learning differences
- Harassment, trolling, or deliberate disruption of discussions
- Dismissing contributions without logical justification

---

## Logic-First Principle

All debates in the EngLite community must ultimately be resolved by logic,
efficiency, and consistency — not by authority, aesthetics, or personal preference.

Bad argument:
"It looks wrong."

Good argument:
"This spelling reduces ambiguity and lowers decoding effort."

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards.
They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions
that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub issues,
pull requests, discussions, and any other official communication channels.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers.

Maintainers will review and investigate all complaints and respond in a manner
they deem appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant,
